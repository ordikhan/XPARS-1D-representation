# XPARS-1D-representation.-
This repository contains the genetic code of the Chart-base one-dimensional representation of the CVD risk score part of the published article project ("An evolutionary machine learning algorithm for cardiovascular disease risk prediction").  The method is the non-cholesterol approach, in which each block is a 4Ã—1 matrix representing the assessed risk at different BP intervals, thus is called the one-dimensional (1D) representation. 
This is the code that uses only 5 risk factor ('blood_preMIure;, 'sex', 'whr', 'smoker', 'age').
